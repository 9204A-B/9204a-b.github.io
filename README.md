# The John Cooper School Robotics Club | 9204A / 9204B Dragons
---
## Welcome to the official website for the John Cooper School Robotics Club.
We principally run two teams for the VEX V5 Robotics Competitions: **9204A Dragons** and **9204B Dragons**.

### Getting involved
Any high school student in the John Cooper School is eligible to join. No prior experience is needed, only an enthusiasm to learn requisite skills. New members are recommended to join **9204B**, where experienced team leaders will help impart useful knowledge. Experienced members are encouraged to participate in **9204A**.
